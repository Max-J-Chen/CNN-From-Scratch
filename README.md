# CNN-From-Scratch
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using Python and NumPy. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the fundamental mechanics behind forward and backward propagation in CNNs, offering a hands-on exploration of key layers used in scene image classifier model architectures. While lacking the optimization and efficiency of mainstream machine learning packages, this project serves as an educational resource for those interested in understanding the inner workings of CNNs.
